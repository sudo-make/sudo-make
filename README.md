### Hey there 👋
My name is Callum-James Smith; I am a 3rd year student at the university of essex; studying computer science.
I'm a self-taught game developer 🕹, mostly specialising in Unity, Java and C#. I also create websites 🐱‍🐉, and mess around with linux 🐧.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Individual Capstone Project

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with MonoGame things...
- 📫 How to reach me: Best way is via [📧 Callum@sudo-make.co.uk](mailto:Callum@sudo-make.co.uk)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love dragons! 🐉
